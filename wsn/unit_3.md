### What is Radio Frequency?

RF is the lowest portion in the electromagnetic spectrum familiar as a medium of analogue and modern digital wireless communication system. It spreads in the range between 3 KHz and 300 GHz. All known transmission systems works in the RF spectrum range including analogue radio, aircraft navigation, marine radio, amateur radio, TV broadcasting, mobile networks and satellite systems. Let’s take a look on each of the RF sub bands and the areas of RF spectrum uses.

![Applications-of-RF-bands](https://www.rfpage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Applications-of-RF-bands.png)



**Signals**

Signals are the physical representation of data. Users of a communication system can only exchange data through the transmission of signals. Layer 1 of the ISO/OSI basic reference model is responsible for the conversion of data, i.e., bits, into signals and vice versa (Halsall, 1996), (Stallings, 1997 and 2002). Signals are functions of time and location. Signal parameters represent the data values. The most interesting types of signals for radio transmission are periodic signals, especially sine waves as carriers.

Signal parameters are the amplitude A, the frequency f, and the phase shift φ. The amplitude as a factor of the function g may also change over time, thus At, (see section 2.6.1). The frequency f expresses the periodicity of the signal with the period T = 1/f. (In equations, ω is frequently used instead of 2πf.) The frequency f may also change over time, thus ft, (see section 2.6.2). Finally, the phase shift determines the shift of the signal relative to the same signal without a shift.

**Antennas**

As the name wireless already indicates, this communication mode involves ‘getting rid’ of wires and transmitting signals through space without guidance. We do not need any ‘medium’ (such as an ether) for the transport of electromagnetic waves. Somehow, we have to couple the energy from the transmitter to the outside world and, in reverse, from the outside world to the receiver. This is exactly what antennas do. Antennas couple electromagnetic energy to and from space to and from a wire or coaxial cable (or any other appropriate conductor). A theoretical reference antenna is the isotropic radiator, a point in space radiating equal power in all directions, i.e., all points with equal power are located on a sphere with the antenna as its center. The radiation pattern is symmetric in all directions.

However, such an antenna does not exist in reality. Real antennas all exhibit directive effects, i.e., the intensity of radiation is not the same in all directions from the antenna. The simplest real antenna is a thin, center-fed dipole, also called Hertzian dipole,The dipole consists of two collinear conductors of equal length, separated by a small feeding gap. The length of the dipole is not arbitrary, but, for example, half the wavelength λ of the signal to transmit results in a very efficient radiation of the energy. If mounted on the roof of a car, the length of λ/4 is efficient. This is also known as Marconi antenna.

**Signal Propogation**

Like wired networks, wireless communication networks also have senders and receivers of signals. However, in connection with signal propagation, these two networks exhibit considerable differences. In wireless networks, the signal has no wire to determine the direction of propagation, whereas signals in wired networks only travel along the wire (which can be twisted pair copper wires, a coax cable, but also a fiber etc.). As long as the wire is not interrupted or damaged, it typically exhibits the same characteristics at each point. One can precisely determine the behavior of a signal travelling along this wire, e.g., received power depending on the length. For wireless transmission, this predictable behavior is only valid in a vacuum, i.e., without matter between the sender and the receiver.

* **Transmission range:** Within a certain radius of the sender transmission is
  possible, i.e., a receiver receives the signals with an error rate low enough to
  be able to communicate and can also act as sender.

* **Detection range:** Within a second radius, detection of the transmission is
  possible, i.e., the transmitted power is large enough to differ from background
  noise. However, the error rate is too high to establish communication.

* **Interference range:** Within a third even larger radius, the sender may interfere with other transmission by adding to the background noise. A receiver will not be able to detect the signals, but the signals may disturb other signals.

**Path loss of radio signals**
In free space radio signals propagate as light does (independently of their frequency), i.e., they follow a straight line (besides gravitational effects). If such a straight line exists between a sender and a receiver it is called line-of-sight (LOS). Even if no matter exists between the sender and the receiver (i.e., if there is a vacuum), the signal still experiences the free space loss. The received power Pr is proportional to 1/d2 with d being the distance between sender and receiver (inverse square law). The reason for this phenomenon is quite simple. Think of the sender being a point in space. The sender now emits a signal with certain energy. This signal travels away from the sender at the speed of light as a wave with a spherical shape. If there is no obstacle, the sphere continuously grows with the sending energy equally distributed over the sphere’s surface. This surface area s grows with the increasing distance d from the center according to the equation s = 4π d2.

Depending on the frequency, radio waves can also penetrate objects. Generally the lower the frequency, the better the penetration. Long waves can be transmitted through the oceans to a submarine while high frequencies can be blocked by a tree. The higher the frequency, the more the behavior of the radio waves resemble that of light

Radio waves can exhibit three fundamental propagation behaviors depending
on their frequency:

* Ground wave (<2 MHz): Waves with low frequencies follow the earth’s surface and can propagate long distances. These waves are used for, e.g., submarine communication or AM radio.

* Sky wave (2–30 MHz): Many international broadcasts and amateur radio use these short waves that are reflected2 at the ionosphere. This way the waves can bounce back and forth between the ionosphere and the earth’s surface, travelling around the world.

* Line-of-sight (>30 MHz): Mobile phone systems, satellite systems, cordless telephones etc. use even higher frequencies. The emitted waves follow a (more or less) straight line of sight. This enables direct communication with satellites (no reflection at the ionosphere) or microwave links on the ground. However, an additional consideration for ground-based communication is that the waves are bent by the atmosphere due to refraction.

**Multiplexing**

Multiplexing is not only a fundamental mechanism in communication systems but also in everyday life. Multiplexing describes how several users can share a medium with minimum or no interference. One example, is highways with several lanes. Many users (car drivers) use the same medium (the highways) with hopefully no interference (i.e., accidents). This is possible due to the provision of several lanes (space division multiplexing) separating the traffic. In addition, different cars use the same medium (i.e., the same lane) at different points in time (time division multiplexing). 

**Space division multiplexing**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/K3auYAi.png)

For wireless communication, multiplexing can be carried out in four dimensions: space, time, frequency, and code. In this field, the task of multiplexing is to assign space, time, frequency, and code to each communication channel with a minimum of interference and a maximum of medium utilization. 

Figure shows six channels ki and introduces a three dimensional coordinate system. This system shows the dimensions of code c, time t and frequency f. For this first type of multiplexing, space division multiplexing (SDM), the (three dimensional) space si is also shown. Here space is represented via circles indicating the interference range as introduced in Figure 2.11. How is the separation of the different channels achieved? The channels k1 to k3 can be mapped onto the three ‘spaces’ s1 to s3 which clearly separate the channels and prevent the interference ranges from overlapping. The space between the interference ranges is sometimes called guard space. Such a guard space is needed in all four multiplexing schemes presented.

For the remaining channels (k4 to k6) three additional spaces would be needed. In our highway example this would imply that each driver had his or her own lane. Although this procedure clearly represents a waste of space, this is exactly the principle used by the old analog telephone system: each subscriber is given a separate pair of copper wires to the local exchange. In wireless transmission, SDM implies a separate sender for each communication channel with a wide enough distance between senders. This multiplexing scheme is used, for example, at FM radio stations where the transmission range is limited to a certain region many radio stations around the world can use the same frequency without interference. Using SDM, obvious problems arise if two or more channels were established within the same space, for example, if several radio stations want to broadcast in the same city. Then, one of the following multiplexing schemes must be used (frequency, time, or code division multiplexing).

**Frequency division multiplexing**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/WIyKQxB.png)

Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) describes schemes to subdivide the frequency dimension into several non-overlapping frequency bands as shown in Figure 2.17. Each channel ki is now allotted its own frequency band as indicated. Senders using a certain frequency band can use this band continuously. Again, guard spaces are needed to avoid frequency band overlapping (also called adjacent channel interference). This scheme is used for radio stations within the same region, where each radio station has its own frequency. This very simple multiplexing scheme does not need complex coordination between sender and receiver: the receiver only has to tune in to the specific sender.

However, this scheme also has disadvantages. While radio stations broadcast 24 hours a day, mobile communication typically takes place for only a few minutes at a time. Assigning a separate frequency for each possible communication scenario would be a tremendous waste of (scarce) frequency resources. Additionally, the fixed assignment of a frequency to a sender makes the scheme very inflexible and limits the number of senders.

**Time division multiplexing**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7Rxk2SK.png)

A more flexible multiplexing scheme for typical mobile communications is time division multiplexing (TDM). Here a channel ki is given the whole bandwidth for a certain amount of time, i.e., all senders use the same frequency but at different points in time (see Figure 2.18). Again, guard spaces, which now represent time gaps, have to separate the different periods when the senders use the medium. In our highway example, this would refer to the gap between two cars. If two transmissions overlap in time, this is called co-channel interference. (In the highway example, interference between two cars results in an accident.) To avoid this type of interference, precise synchronization between different senders is necessary. This is clearly a disadvantage, as all senders need precise clocks or, alternatively, a way has to be found to distribute a synchronization signal to all senders. For a receiver tuning in to a sender this does not just involve adjusting the frequency, but involves listening at exactly the right point in time. However, this scheme is quite flexible as one can assign more sending time to senders with a heavy load and less to those with a light load.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qj4jWEz.png)

Frequency and time division multiplexing can be combined, i.e., a channel ki can use a certain frequency band for a certain amount of time as shown in Figure 2.19. Now guard spaces are needed both in the time and in the frequency dimension. This scheme is more robust against frequency selective interference, i.e., interference in a certain small frequency band. A channel may use this band only for a short period of time. Additionally, this scheme provides some (weak) protection against tapping, as in this case the sequence of frequencies a sender uses has to be known to listen in to a channel. The mobile phone standard GSM uses this combination of frequency and time division multiplexing for transmission between a mobile phone and a so-called base station.

A disadvantage of this scheme is again the necessary coordination between different senders. One has to control the sequence of frequencies and the time of changing to another frequency. Two senders will interfere as soon as they select the same frequency at the same time. However, if the frequency change (also called frequency hopping) is fast enough, the periods of interference may be so small that, depending on the coding of data into signals, a receiver can still recover the original data.

**Code division multiplexing**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/B13zXsx.png)

While SDM and FDM are well known from the early days of radio transmission and TDM is used in connection with many applications, code division multiplexing (CDM) is a relatively new scheme in commercial communication systems. First used in military applications due to its inherent security features (together with spread spectrum techniques, see section 2.7), it now features in many civil wireless transmission scenarios thanks to the availability of cheap processing power (explained in more detail in section 3.5). Figure 2.20 shows how all channels ki use the same frequency at the same time for transmission. Separation is now achieved by assigning each channel its own ‘code’, guard spaces are realized by using codes with the necessary ‘distance’ in code space, e.g., orthogonal codes. The technical realization of CDM is discussed in section 2.7 and chapter 3 together with the medium access mechanisms. An excellent book dealing with all aspects of CDM is Viterbi (1995).
The typical everyday example of CDM is a party with many participants from different countries around the world who establish communication channels, i.e., they talk to each other, using the same frequency range (approx. 300–6000 Hz depending on a person’s voice) at the same time. If everybody speaks the same language, SDM is needed to be able to communicate talking with limited transmit power). But as soon as another code, i.e., another language, is used, one can tune in to this language and clearly separate communication in this language from all the other languages. (The other languages appear as background noise.) 

This explains why CDM has built-in security: if the language is unknown, the signals can still be received, but they are useless. By using a secret code (or language), a secure channel can be established in a ‘hostile’ environment. (At parties this may cause some confusion.) Guard spaces are also of importance in this illustrative example. Using, e.g., Swedish and Norwegian does not really work; the languages aretoo close. But Swedish and Finnish are ‘orthogonal’ enough to separate the communication channels.
The main advantage of CDM for wireless transmission is that it gives good protection against interference and tapping. Different codes have to be assigned, but code space is huge compared to the frequency space. Assigning individual codes to each sender does not usually cause problems. 

The main disadvantage of this scheme is the relatively high complexity of the receiver (see section 3.5). A receiver has to know the code and must separate the channel with user data from the background noise composed of other signals and environmental noise. Additionally, a receiver must be precisely synchronized with the transmitter to apply the decoding correctly. The voice example also gives a hint to another problem of CDM receivers. All signals should reach a receiver with almost equal strength, otherwise some signals could drain others. If some people close to a receiver talk very loudly the language does not matter. The receiver cannot listen to any other person. To apply CDM, precise power control is required.



**Modulation**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/h6EdETk.jpg)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/01ngjxh.jpg)

This function has three parameters: amplitude At, frequency ft, and phase φt which may be varied in accordance with data or another modulating signal. For digital modulation, which is the main topic in this section, digital data (0 and 1) is translated into an analog signal (baseband signal). Digital modulation is required if digital data has to be transmitted over a medium that only allows for analog transmission. One example for wired networks is the old analog telephone system – to connect a computer to this system a modem is needed. The modem then performs the translation of digital data into analog signals and vice versa. Digital transmission is used, for example, in wired local area networks or within a computer (Halsall, 1996), (Stallings, 1997). In wireless networks, however, digital transmission cannot be used. Here, the binary bit-stream has to be translated into an analog signal first. The three basic methods for this translation are amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK), and phase shift keying (PSK).



**Amplitude Shift Keying**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/iUMLcMF.jpg)

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), the most simple digital modulation scheme. The two binary values, 1 and 0, are represented by two different amplitudes. In the example, one of the amplitudes is 0 (representing the binary 0). This simple scheme only requires low bandwidth, but is very susceptible to interference. Effects like multi-path propagation, noise, or path loss heavily influence the amplitude. In a wireless environment, a constant amplitude

 Analog  modulation Digital modulation Analog baseband signal Radio carrier Digital data 101101001 Figure 2.21 Modulation in a transmitter Analog demodulation Synchronization decision Analog baseband signal Radio carrier Digital data 101101001 Figure 2.22 Demodulation and data reconstruction in a receiver cannot be guaranteed, so ASK is typically not used for wireless radio transmission. However, the wired transmission scheme with the highest performance, namely optical transmission, uses ASK. Here, a light pulse may represent a 1, while the absence of light represents a 0. The carrier frequency in optical systems is some hundred THz. ASK can also be applied to wireless infra red transmission, using a directed beam or diffuse light

**Frequency Shift Keying**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uDeJ5Rn.jpg)

A modulation scheme often used for wireless transmission is frequency shift keying (FSK) (see Figure 2.24). The simplest form of FSK, also called binary FSK (BFSK), assigns one frequency f1 to the binary 1 and another frequency f2 to the binary 0. A very simple way to implement FSK is to switch between two oscillators, one with the frequency f1 and the other with f2, depending on the input. To avoid sudden changes in phase, special frequency modulators with continuous phase modulation, (CPM) can be used. Sudden changes in phase cause high frequencies, which is an undesired side-effect. 

A simple way to implement demodulation is by using two bandpass filters, one for f1 the other for f2. A comparator can then compare the signal levels of the filter outputs to decide which of them is stronger. FSK needs a larger bandwidth compared to ASK but is much less susceptible to errors.

**Phase Shift Keying**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Df6M5BL.jpg)

Finally, phase shift keying (PSK) uses shifts in the phase of a signal to represent data. Figure 2.25 shows a phase shift of 180° or π as the 0 follows the 1 (the same happens as the 1 follows the 0). This simple scheme, shifting the phase by 180° each time the value of data changes, is also called binary PSK (BPSK). A simple implementation of a BPSK modulator could multiply a frequency f with +1 if the binary data is 1 and with –1 if the binary data is 0. To receive the signal correctly, the receiver must synchronize in frequency and phase with the transmitter. This can be done using a phase lock loop (PLL). Compared to FSK, PSK is more resistant to interference, but receiver and transmitter are also more complex.

**Spread Spectrum**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eZCzVnG.png)

Spread spectrum techniques involve spreading the bandwidth needed to transmit data – which does not make sense at first sight. Spreading the bandwidth has several advantages. The main advantage is the resistance to narrowband interference. In Figure 2.32, diagram 

1.  shows an idealized narrowband signal from a sender of user data (here power density dP/df versus frequency f). The sender now spreads the signal in step ii)
2.  converts the narrowband signal into a broadband signal. The energy needed to transmit the signal (the area shown in the diagram) is the same, but it is now spread over a larger frequency range. The power level of the spread signal can be much lower than that of the original narrowband signal without losing data. Depending on the generation and reception of the spread signal, the power level of the user signal can even be as low as the background noise. This makes it difficult to distinguish the user signal from the background noise and thus hard to detect. During transmission, narrowband and broadband interference add to the
    signal in step iii).
3.  The sum of interference and user signal is received. The receiver now knows how to despread the signal, converting the spread user signal into a narrowband signal again, while spreading the narrowband interference and leaving the broadband interference. 
4.  the receiver applies abandpass filter to cut off frequencies left and right of the narrowband signal.Finally, the receiver can reconstruct the original data because the power level of the user signal is high enough, i.e., the signal is much stronger than the remaining
    interference.

**Cellular System**

Cellular systems for mobile communications implement SDM. Each transmitter, typically called a base station, covers a certain area, a cell. Cell radii can vary from tens of meters in buildings, and hundreds of meters in cities, up to tens of kilometers in the countryside. The shape of cells are never perfect circles or hexagons (as shown in Figure 2.41), but depend on the environment (buildings, mountains, valleys etc.), on weather conditions, and sometimes even on system load. Typical systems using this approach are mobile telecommunication systems (see chapter 4), where a mobile station within the cell around a base station communicates with this base station and vice versa.

Advantages of cellular systems with small cells are the following:

* Higher capacity: Implementing SDM allows frequency reuse. If one transmitter is far away from another, i.e., outside the interference range, it can reuse the same frequencies. As most mobile phone systems assign frequencies to certain users (or certain hopping patterns), this frequency is blocked for other users. But frequencies are a scarce resource and, the number of concurrent users per cell is very limited. Huge cells do not allow for more users. On the contrary, they are limited to less possible users per km2. This is also the reason for using very small cells in cities where many more people use mobile phones.

* Less transmission power: While power aspects are not a big problem for base stations, they are indeed problematic for mobile stations. A receiver far away from a base station would need much more transmit power than the current few Watts. But energy is a serious problem for mobile handheld devices.

* Local interference only: Having long distances between sender and receiver results in even more interference problems. With small cells, mobile stations and base stations only have to deal with ‘local’ interference.

* Robustness: Cellular systems are decentralized and so, more robust against the failure of single components. If one antenna fails, this only influences communication within a small area

Small cells also have some disadvantages: 

* Infrastructure needed: Cellular systems need a complex infrastructure to connect all base stations. This includes many antennas, switches for call forwarding, location registers to find a mobile station etc, which makes the whole system quite expensive.
* Handover needed: The mobile station has to perform a handover when changing from one cell to another. Depending on the cell size and the speed of movement, this can happen quite often.
* Frequency planning: To avoid interference between transmitters using the same frequencies, frequencies have to be distributed carefully. On the one hand, interference should be avoided, on the other, only a limited number of frequencies is available.

Telecommunication, Satellite and Broadcast Systems: GSM

GSM is the most successful digital mobile telecommunication system in the world today. It is used by over 800 million people in more than 190 countries. In the early 1980s, Europe had numerous coexisting analog mobile phone systems, which were often based on similar standards (e.g., NMT 450), but ran on slightly different carrier frequencies. To avoid this situation for a second generation fully digital system, the groupe spéciale mobile (GSM) was founded in 1982. This system was soon named the global system for mobile communications (GSM), with the specification process lying in the hands of ETSI (ETSI, 2002), (GSM Association, 2002). In the context of UMTS and the creation of 3GPP (Third generation partnership project, 3GPP, 2002a) the whole development process of GSM was transferred to 3GPP and further development is combined with 3G development. 3GPP assigned new numbers to all GSM standards. However, to remain consistent with most of the GSM literature, this GSM section stays with the original numbering (see 3GPP, 2002a, for conversion).

The primary goal of GSM was to provide a mobile phone system that allows users to roam throughout Europe and provides voice services compatible to ISDN and other PSTN systems. The specification for the initial system already covers more than 5,000 pages; new services, in particular data services, now add even more specification details. Readers familiar with the ISDN reference model will recognize many similar acronyms, reference points, and interfaces. GSM standardization aims at adopting as much as possible.

**Mobile Services**

GSM permits the integration of different voice and data services and the interworking with existing networks. Services make a network interesting for customers. GSM has defined three different categories of services: bearer, tele, and supplementary services. These are described in the following subsections. Figure 4.3 shows a reference model for GSM services. A mobile station MS is connected to the GSM public land mobile network (PLMN) via the Um interface. (GSM-PLMN is the infrastructure needed for the GSM network.) This network is connected to transit networks, e.g., integrated services digital network (ISDN) or traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN). There might be an additional network, the source/destination network, before another terminal TE is connected. Bearer services now comprise all services that enable the transparent transmission of data between the interfaces to the network, i.e., S in case of the mobile station, and a similar interface for the other terminal (e.g., S0 for ISDN terminals). Interfaces like U, S, and R in case of ISDN have not been defined for all networks, so it depends on the specific network which interface is used as a reference for the transparent transmission of data. In the classical GSM model, bearer services are connection-oriented and circuit- or packet-switched. These services only need the lower three layers of the ISO/OSI reference model.

Within the mobile station MS, the mobile termination (MT) performs all network specific tasks (TDMA, FDMA, coding etc.) and offers an interface for data transmission (S) to the terminal TE which can then be network independent. Depending on the capabilities of TE, further interfaces may be needed, such as R, according to the ISDN reference model (Halsall, 1996). Tele services are application specific and may thus need all seven layers of the ISO/OSI reference model. These services are specified end-to-end, i.e., from one terminal TE to another.

1. **Bearer services**
   GSM specifies different mechanisms for data transmission, the original GSM allowing for data rates of up to 9600 bit/s for non-voice services. Bearer services permit transparent and non-transparent, synchronous or asynchronous data transmission. Transparent bearer services only use the functions of the physical layer (layer 1) to transmit data. Data transmission has a constant delay and throughput if no transmission errors occur. The only mechanism to increase transmission quality is the use of forward error correction (FEC), which codes redundancy into the data stream and helps to reconstruct the original data in case of transmission errors. Depending on the FEC, data rates of 2.4, 4.8, or 9.6 kbit/s are possible. Transparent bearer services do not try to recover lost data in case of, for example, shadowing or interruptions due to handover.
   Non-transparent bearer services use protocols of layers two and three to implement error correction and flow control. These services use the transparent bearer services, adding a radio link protocol (RLP). This protocol comprises  mechanisms of high-level data link control (HDLC), (Halsall, 1996) and special selective-reject mechanisms to trigger retransmission of erroneous data. The achieved bit error rate is less than 10–7, but now throughput and delay may vary depending on transmission quality.
2. **Tele services**
   GSM mainly focuses on voice-oriented tele services. These comprise encrypted voice transmission, message services, and basic data communication with terminals as known from the PSTN or ISDN (e.g., fax). However, as the main service is telephony, the primary goal of GSM was the provision of high-quality digital voice transmission, offering at least the typical bandwidth of 3.1 kHz of analog phone systems. Special codecs (coder/decoder) are used for voice transmission, while other codecs are used for the transmission of analog data for communication with traditional computer modems used in, e.g., fax machines. Another service offered by GSM is the emergency number. The same number can be used throughout Europe. This service is mandatory for all providers and free of charge. This connection also has the highest priority, possibly pre-empting other connections, and will automatically be set up with the closest emergency center. A useful service for very simple message transfer is the short message service (SMS), which offers transmission of messages of up to 160 characters. SMS messages do not use the standard data channels of GSM but exploit unused capacity in the signalling channels (see section 4.1.3.1). Sending and receiving of SMS is possible during data or voice transmission. SMS was in the GSM standard from the beginning; however, almost no one used it until millions of young people discovered this service in the mid-nineties as a fun service.
3. **Supplementary services**
   In addition to tele and bearer services, GSM providers can offer supplementary services. Similar to ISDN networks, these services offer various enhancements for the standard telephony service, and may vary from provider to provider. Typical services are user identification, call redirection, or forwarding of ongoing calls. Standard ISDN features such as closed user groups and multiparty communication may be available. Closed user groups are of special interest to companies because they allow, for example, a company-specific GSM sub-network, to which only members of the group have access.

**Architecture**

GSM comes with a hierarchical, complex system architecture comprising many entities, interfaces, and acronyms. Figure 4.4 gives a simplified overview of the GSM system as specified in ETSI (1991b). A GSM system consists of three subsystems, the radio sub system (RSS), the network and switching subsystem (NSS), and the operation subsystem (OSS). Each subsystem will be discussed in more detail in the following sections. Generally, a GSM customer only notices a very small fraction of the whole network – the mobile stations (MS) and some antenna masts of the base transceiver stations (BTS).

1. **Radio subsystem**
   As the name implies, the radio subsystem (RSS) comprises all radio specific entities, i.e., the mobile stations (MS) and the base station subsystem (BSS). Figure 4.4 shows the connection between the RSS and the NSS via the A interface (solid lines) and the connection to the OSS via the O interface (dashed lines). The A interface is typically based on circuit-switched PCM-30 systems (2.048 Mbit/s), carrying up to 30 64 kbit/s connections, whereas the O interface uses the Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) based on X.25 carrying management data to/from the RSS.

* Base station subsystem (BSS): A GSM network comprises many BSSs, each controlled by a base station controller (BSC). The BSS performs all functions necessary to maintain radio connections to an MS, coding/decoding of voice, and rate adaptation to/from the wireless network part. Besides a BSC, the BSS contains several BTSs.

* Base transceiver station (BTS): A BTS comprises all radio equipment, i.e., antennas, signal processing, amplifiers necessary for radio transmission. A BTS can form a radio cell or, using sectorized antennas, several cells (see section 2.8), and is connected to MS via the Um interface (ISDN U interface for mobile use), and to the BSC via the Abis interface. The Um interface contains all the mechanisms necessary for wireless transmission (TDMA, FDMA etc.) and will be discussed in more detail below. The Abis interface consists of 16 or 64 kbit/s connections. A GSM cell can measure between some 100 m and 35 km depending on the environment (buildings, open space, mountains etc.) but also expected traffic. 

* Base station controller (BSC): The BSC basically manages the BTSs. It reserves radio frequencies, handles the handover from one BTS to another within the BSS, and performs paging of the MS. The BSC also multiplexes the radio channels onto the fixed network connections at the A interface.

* Mobile station (MS): The MS comprises all user equipment and software needed for communication with a GSM network. An MS consists of user independent hard- and software and of the subscriber identity module (SIM), which stores all user-specific data that is relevant to GSM.3 While an MS can be identified via the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI), a user can personalize any MS using his or her SIM, i.e., user-specific mechanisms like charging and authentication are based on the SIM, not on the device itself. Device-specific mechanisms, e.g., theft protection, use the device specific IMEI. Without the SIM, only emergency calls are possible. The SIM card contains many identifiers and tables, such as card-type, serial number, a list of subscribed services, a personal identity number (PIN), a PIN unblocking key (PUK), an authentication key Ki, and the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) (ETSI, 1991c). The PIN is used to unlock the MS. Using the wrong PIN three times will lock the SIM. In such cases, the PUK is needed to unlock the SIM. The MS stores dynamic information while logged onto the GSM system, such as, e.g., the cipher key Kc and the location information consisting of a temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI) and the location area identification (LAI). Typical MSs for GS 900 have a transmit power of up to 2 W, whereas for GSM 1800 1 W is enough due to the smaller cell size.

2. **Network and Switching Subsystem (NSS)**

The “heart” of the GSM system is formed by the network and switching subsystem (NSS). The NSS connects the wireless network with standard public networks, performs handovers between different BSSs, comprises functions for worldwide localization of users and supports charging, accounting, and roaming of users between different providers in different countries. The NSS consists of the following switches and databases:

* Mobile services switching center (MSC): MSCs are high-performance digital ISDN switches. They set up connections to other MSCs and to the BSCs via the A interface, and form the fixed backbone network of a GSM system. Typically, an MSC manages several BSCs in a geographical region. A gateway MSC (GMSC) has additional connections to other fixed networks, such as PSTN and ISDN. Using additional interworking functions (IWF), an MSC can also connect to public data networks (PDN) such as X.25. An MSC handles all signaling needed for connection setup, connection release and handover of connections to other MSCs. The standard signaling system No. 7 (SS7) is used for this purpose. SS7 covers all aspects of control signalingfor digital networks (reliable routing and delivery of control messages, establishing and monitoring of calls). Features of SS7 are number portability, free phone/toll/collect/credit calls, call forwarding, three-way calling etc. An MSC also performs all functions needed for supplementary services such as call forwarding, multi-party calls, reverse charging etc.
* Home location register (HLR): The HLR is the most important database in a GSM system as it stores all user-relevant information. This comprises static information, such as the mobile subscriber ISDN number (MSISDN), subscribed services (e.g., call forwarding, roaming restrictions, GPRS), and the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI). Dynamic information is also needed, e.g., the current location area (LA) of the MS, the mobile subscriber roaming number (MSRN), the current VLR and MSC. As soon as an MS leaves its current LA, the information in the HLR is updated. This information is necessary to localize a user in the worldwide GSM network. All these user-specific information elements only exist once for each user in a single HLR, which also supports charging and accounting. The parameters will be explained in more detail in section 4.1.5. HLRs can manage data for several million customers and contain highly specialized data bases which must fulfill certain real-time requirements to answer requests within certain time-bounds.
* Visitor location register (VLR): The VLR associated to each MSC is a dynamic database which stores all important information needed for the MS users currently in the LA that is associated to the MSC (e.g., IMSI, MSISDN, HLR address). If a new MS comes into an LA the VLR is responsible for, it copies all relevant information for this user from the HLR. This hierarchy of VLR and HLR avoids frequent HLR updates and long-distance signaling of user information. The typical use of HLR and VLR for user localization will be described in section 4.1.5. Some VLRs in existence, are capable of managing up to one million customers.

3. Operation subsystem
   The third part of a GSM system, the operation subsystem (OSS), contains the necessary functions for network operation and maintenance. The OSS possesses network entities of its own and accesses other entities via SS7 signaling (see Figure 4.4). The following entities have been defined:

* Operation and maintenance center (OMC): The OMC monitors and controls
  all other network entities via the O interface (SS7 with X.25). Typical
  OMC management functions are traffic monitoring, status reports of network
  entities, subscriber and security management, or accounting and
  billing. OMCs use the concept of telecommunication management network
  (TMN) as standardized by the ITU-T.
* Authentication centre (AuC): As the radio interface and mobile stations
  are particularly vulnerable, a separate AuC has been defined to protect user
  identity and data transmission. The AuC contains the algorithms for
  authentication as well as the keys for encryption and generates the values
  needed for user authentication in the HLR. The AuC may, in fact, be situated
  in a special protected part of the HLR.
* Equipment identity register (EIR): The EIR is a database for all IMEIs, i.e.,
  it stores all device identifications registered for this network. As MSs are
  mobile, they can be easily stolen. With a valid SIM, anyone could use the
  stolen MS. The EIR has a blacklist of stolen (or locked) devices. In theory an
  MS is useless as soon as the owner has reported a theft. Unfortunately, the
  blacklists of different providers are not usually synchronized and the illegal
  use of a device in another operator’s network is possible (the reader may
  speculate as to why this is the case). The EIR also contains a list of valid
  IMEIs (white list), and a list of malfunctioning devices (gray list).

**Radio Interface**

The most interesting interface in a GSM system is Um, the radio interface, as it comprises many mechanisms for multiplexing and media access. GSM implements SDMA using cells with BTS and assigns an MS to a BTS. Furthermore, FDD is used to separate downlink and uplink.Media access combines TDMA and FDMA. In GSM 900, 124 channels, each 200 kHz wide, are used for FDMA, whereas GSM 1800 uses, 374 channels. Due to technical reasons, channels 1 and 124 are not used for transmission in GSM 900. Typically, 32 channels are reserved for organizational data; the remaining 90 are used for customers. Each BTS then manages a single channel for organizational data and, e.g., up to 10 channels for user data. The following example is based on the GSM 900 system, but GSM works in a similar way at 1800 and 1900 MHz.

Each of the 248 channels is additionally separated in time via a GSM TDMA frame, i.e., each 200 kHz carrier is subdivided into frames that are repeated continuously. The duration of a frame is 4.615 ms. A frame is again subdivided into 8 GSM time slots, where each slot represents a physical TDM channel and lasts for 577 μs. Each TDM channel occupies the 200 kHz carrier for 577 μs every 4.615 ms.

Data is transmitted in small portions, called bursts.the burst is only 546.5 μs long and contains 148 bits. The remaining 30.5 μs are used as guard space to avoid overlapping with other bursts due to different path delays and to give the transmitter time to turn on and off. Filling the whole slot with data allows for the transmission of156.25 bit within 577 μs. Each physical TDM channel has a raw data rate of about 33.8 kbit/s, each radio carrier transmits approximately 270 kbit/s over the
Um interface.

The first and last three bits of a normal burst (tail) are all set to 0 and can be used to enhance the receiver performance. The training sequence in the middle of a slot is used to adapt the parameters of the receiver to the current path propagation characteristics and to select the strongest signal in case of multi-path propagation. A flag S indicates whether the data field contains user or network control data. Apart from the normal burst, ETSI (1993a) defines four more bursts for data transmission: a frequency correction burst allows the MS to correct the local oscillator to avoid interference with neighboring channels, a synchronization burst with an extended training sequence synchronizes the MS with the BTS in time, an access burst is used for the initial connection setup between MS and BTS, and finally a dummy burst is used if no data is available for a slot.

Two factors allow for the use of simple transmitter hardware: on the one hand, the slots for uplink and downlink of a physical TDM channel are separated in frequency (45 MHz for GSM 900, 95 MHz for GSM 1800 using FDD). On the other hand, the TDMA frames are shifted in time for three slots, i.e., if the BTS sends data at time t0 in slot one on the downlink, the MS accesses slot one on the uplink at time t0+3·577 μs. An MS does not need a full-duplex transmitter, a simpler half-duplex transmitter switching between receiving and sending is enough. To avoid frequency selective fading, GSM specifies an optional slow frequency hopping mechanism. MS and BTS may change the carrier frequency after each frame based on a common hopping sequence. An MS changes its frequency between up and downlink slots respectively.

**Localization and calling**
One fundamental feature of the GSM system is the automatic, worldwide localization of users. The system always knows where a user currently is, and the same phone number is valid worldwide. To provide this service, GSM performs periodic location updates even if a user does not use the mobile station (provided that the MS is still logged into the GSM network and is not completely switched off). The HLR always contains information about the current location (only the location area, not the precise geographical location), and the VLR currently responsible for the MS informs the HLR about location changes. As soon as an MS moves into the range of a new VLR (a new location area), the HLR sends all user data needed to the new VLR. Changing VLRs with uninterrupted availability of all services is also called roaming. Roaming can take place within the network of one provider, between two providers in one country (national roaming is, often not supported due to competition between operators), but also between different providers in different countries (international roaming). Typically, people associate international roaming with the term roaming as it is this type of roaming that makes GSM very attractive: one device, over 190 countries!

To locate an MS and to address the MS, several numbers are needed:

* **Mobile station international ISDN number (MSISDN):**6 The only important number for a user of GSM is the phone number. Remember that the phone number is not associated with a certain device but with the SIM, which is personalized for a user. The MSISDN follows the ITU-T standard E.164 for addresses as it is also used in fixed ISDN networks. This number consists of the country code (CC) (e.g., +49 179 1234567 with 49 for Germany), the national destination code (NDC) (i.e., the address of the network provider, e.g., 179), and the subscriber number (SN).

* **International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI):** GSM uses the IMSI for internal unique identification of a subscriber. IMSI consists of a mobile country code (MCC) (e.g., 240 for Sweden, 208 for France), the mobile network code (MNC) (i.e., the code of the network provider), and finally the mobile subscriber identification number (MSIN).

* **Temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI):** To hide the IMSI, which would give away the exact identity of the user signaling over the air interface,GSM uses the 4 byte TMSI for local subscriber identification. TMSI is selected by the current VLR and is only valid temporarily and within the location area of the VLR (for an ongoing communication TMSI and LAI are sufficient to identify a user; the IMSI is not needed). Additionally, a VLR may change the TMSI periodically.

* **Mobile station7 roaming number (MSRN):** Another temporary address that hides the identity and location of a subscriber is MSRN. The VLR generates this address on request from the MSC, and the address is also stored in the HLR. MSRN contains the current visitor country code (VCC), the visitor national destination code (VNDC), the identification of the current MSC together with the subscriber number. The MSRN helps the HLR to find a subscriber for an incoming call.

All these numbers are needed to find a subscriber and to maintain the connection with a mobile station. The interesting case is the mobile terminated call (MTC), i.e., a situation in which a station calls a mobile station (the calling station could be outside the GSM network or another mobile station).

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/G4MPE1C.png)

In step 1, a user dials the phone number of a GSM subscriber. The fixed network (PSTN) notices (looking at the destination code) that the number belongs to a user in the GSM network and forwards the call setup to the Gateway MSC (2). The GMSC identifies the HLR for the subscriber (which is coded in the phone number) and signals the call setup to the HLR (3). The HLR now checks whether the number exists and whether the user has subscribed tothe requested services, and requests an MSRN from the current VLR (4). After receiving the MSRN (5), the HLR can determine the MSC responsible for the MS and forwards this information to the GMSC (6). The GMSC can now forward the call setup request to the MSC indicated (7). From this point on, the MSC is responsible for all further steps. First, it requests the current status of the MS from the VLR (8). If the MS is available, the MSC initiates paging in all cells it is responsible for (i.e. the location area, LA, 10), as searching for the right cell would be too time consuming (but this approach puts some load on the signaling channels so optimizations exist). The BTSs of all BSSs transmit this paging signal to the MS (11). If the MS answers (12 and 13), the VLR has to perform security checks (set up encryption etc.). The VLR then signals to the MSC to set up a connection to the MS (steps 15 to 17).

It is much simpler to perform a mobile originated call (MOC) compared to a
MTC (see Figure 4.9). The MS transmits a request for a new connection (1), the BSS
forwards this request to the MSC (2). The MSC then checks if this user is allowed
to set up a call with the requested service (3 and 4) and checks the availability of
resources through the GSM network and into the PSTN. If all resources are available,
the MSC sets up a connection between the MS and the fixed network.

**Handover**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/H9ixKnR.png)

Cellular systems require handover procedures, as single cells do not cover the whole service area, but, e.g., only up to 35 km around each antenna on the countryside and some hundred meters in cities (Tripathi, 1998). The smaller the cell size and the faster the movement of a mobile station through the cells (up to 250 km/h for GSM), the more handovers of ongoing calls are required.However, a handover should not cause a cut-off, also called call drop. GSM aims at maximum handover duration of 60 ms.
There are two basic reasons for a handover (about 40 have been identified
in the standard):

* The mobile station moves out of the range of a BTS or a certain antenna of a BTS respectively. The received signal level decreases continuously until it falls below the minimal requirements for communication. The error rate may grow due to interference, the distance to the BTS may be too high (max. 35 km) etc. – all these effects may diminish the quality of the radio link and make radio transmission impossible in the near future.

* The wired infrastructure (MSC, BSC) may decide that the traffic in one cell is too high and shift some MS to other cells with a lower load (if possible). Handover may be due to load balancing.

Four possible handover scenarios in GSM:

* Intra-cell handover: Within a cell, narrow-band interference could make transmission at a certain frequency impossible. The BSC could then decide to change the carrier frequency (scenario 1).
* Inter-cell, intra-BSC handover: This is a typical handover scenario. The mobile station moves from one cell to another, but stays within the control of the same BSC. The BSC then performs a handover, assigns a new radio channel in the new cell and releases the old one (scenario 2).
* Inter-BSC, intra-MSC handover: As a BSC only controls a limited number of cells; GSM also has to perform handovers between cells controlled by different BSCs. This handover then has to be controlled by the MSC (scenario 3). This situation is also shown in Figure 4.13.
* Inter MSC handover: A handover could be required between two cells belonging to different MSCs. Now both MSCs perform the handover together (scenario 4).

**Security**
GSM offers several security services using confidential information stored in the
AuC and in the individual SIM (which is plugged into an arbitrary MS). The SIM
stores personal, secret data and is protected with a PIN against unauthorized use.
(For example, the secret key Ki used for authentication and encryption procedures
is stored in the SIM.) The security services offered by GSM are explained below:

* Access control and authentication: The first step includes the authentication of a valid user for the SIM. The user needs a secret PIN to access the SIM. The next step is the subscriber authentication (see Figure 4.10). 

* Confidentiality: All user-related data is encrypted. After authentication, BTS and MS apply encryption to voice, data, and signaling. This confidentiality exists only between MS and BTS, but it does not exist end-to-end or within the whole fixed GSM/telephone network.

* Anonymity: To provide user anonymity, all data is encrypted before transmission, and user identifiers (which would reveal an identity) are not used over the air. Instead, GSM transmits a temporary identifier (TMSI), which is newly assigned by the VLR after each location update. Additionally, the VLR can change the TMSI at any time.





New data services
As mentioned above, the standard bandwidth of 9.6 kbit/s (14.4 kbit/s with some providers) available for data transmission is not sufficient for the requirements of today’s computers. When GSM was developed, not many people anticipated the tremendous growth of data communication compared to voice communication. At that time, 9.6 kbit/s was a lot, or at least enough for standard group 3 fax machines. But with the requirements of, e.g., web browsing, file download, or even intensive e-mail exchange with attachments, this is not enough. To enhance the data transmission capabilities of GSM, two basic approaches are possible. As the basic GSM is based on connection-oriented traffic channels, e.g., with 9.6 kbit/s each, several channels could be combined to increase bandwidth. This system is called HSCSD and is presented in the following section. A more progressive step is the introduction of packet-oriented traffic in GSM, i.e., shifting the paradigm from connections/telephone thinking to packets/internet thinking. The system, called GPRS,

**HSCSD**
A straightforward improvement of GSM’s data transmission capabilities is high speed circuit switched data (HSCSD), which is available with some providers. In this system, higher data rates are achieved by bundling several TCHs. An MS requests one or more TCHs from the GSM network, i.e., it allocates several TDMA slots within a TDMA frame. This allocation can be asymmetrical, i.e., more slots can be allocated on the downlink than on the uplink, which fits the typical user behavior of downloading more data compared to uploading. Basically, HSCSD only requires software upgrades in an MS and MSC (both have to be able to split a traffic stream into several streams, using a separate TCH each, and to combine these streams again).

**GPRS**
The next step toward more flexible and powerful data transmission avoids the problems of HSCSD by being fully packet-oriented. The general packet radio service (GPRS) provides packet mode transfer for applications that exhibit traffic patterns such as frequent transmission of small volumes (e.g., typical web requests) or infrequent transmissions of small or medium volumes (e.g., typical web responses) according to the requirement specification (ETSI, 1998a). Compared to existing data transfer services, GPRS should use the existing network resources more efficiently for packet mode applications, and should provide a selection of QoS parameters for the service requesters. GPRS should also allow for broadcast, multicast, and unicast service. The overall goal in this context is the provision of a more efficient and, thus, cheaper packet transfer service for typical internet applications that usually rely solely on packet transfer. Network providers typically support this model by charging on volume and not on connection time as is usual for traditional GSM data services and for HSCSD. The main benefit for users of GPRS is the ‘always on’ characteristic – no connection has to be set up prior to data transfer. Clearly, GPRS was driven by the tremendous success of the packet-oriented internet, and by the new traffic models and applications. However, GPRS, as shown in the following sections, needs additional network elements, i.e., software and hardware. Unlike HSCSD, GPRS does not only represent a software update to allow for the bundling of channels, it also represents a big step towards UMTS as the main internal infrastructure needed for UMTS (in its initial release) is exactly what GPRS uses.

The main concepts of GPRS are as follows (ETSI, 1998b). For the new GPRS radio channels, the GSM system can allocate between one and eight time slots within a TDMA frame. Time slots are not allocated in a fixed, pre-determined manner but on demand. All time slots can be shared by the active users; up- and downlink are allocated separately. Allocation of the slots is based on current load and operator preferences. Depending on the coding, a transfer rate of up to 170 kbit/s is possible. For GPRS, operators often reserve at least a time slot per cell to guarantee a minimum data rate. The GPRS concept is independent of channel characteristics and of the type of channel (traditional GSM traffic or control channel), and does not limit the maximum data rate (only the GSM transport system limits the rate). All GPRS services can be used in parallel to conventional services.

**DECT**

Another fully digital cellular network is the digital enhanced cordless telecommunications (DECT) system specified by ETSI (2002, 1998j, k), (DECT Forum, 2002). Formerly also called digital European cordless telephone and digital European cordless telecommunications, DECT replaces older analog cordless phone systems such as CT1 and CT1+. These analog systems only ensured security to a limited extent as they did not use encryption for data transmission and only offered a relatively low capacity. DECT is also a more powerful alternative to the digital system CT2, which is mainly used in the UK (the DECT standard works throughout Europe), and has even been selected as one of the 3G candidates in the IMT-2000 family (see section 4.4). DECT is mainly used in offices, on campus, at trade shows, or in the home. Furthermore, access points to the PSTN can be established within, e.g., railway stations, large government buildings and hospitals, offering a much cheaper telephone service compared to a GSM system. DECT could also be used to bridge the last few hundred meters between a new network operator and customers. Using this ‘small range’ local loop, new companies can offer their service without having their own lines installed in the streets. DECT systems offer many different interworking units, e.g., with GSM, ISDN, or data networks. Currently, over 100 million DECT units are in use (DECT, 2002). 

A big difference between DECT and GSM exists in terms of cell diameter and cell capacity. While GSM is designed for outdoor use with a cell diameter of up to 70 km, the range of DECT is limited to about 300 m from the base station(only around 50 m are feasible inside buildings depending on the walls). Due to this limited range and additional multiplexing techniques, DECT can offer its service to some 10,000 people within one km2. This is a typical scenario within a big city, where thousands of offices are located in skyscrapers close together. DECT also uses base stations, but these base stations together with a mobile station are in a price range of €100 compared to several €10,000 for a GSM base station. GSM base stations can typically not be used by individuals for private networks. One reason is licensing as all GSM frequencies have been licensed to network operators. DECT can also handle handover, but it was not designed to work at a higher speed (e.g., up to 250 km/h like GSM systems). Devices handling GSM and DECT exist but have never been a commercial success.

**System architecture**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/N6iWMba.png)

A DECT system, may have various different physical implementation depending on its actual use. Different DECT entities can be integrated into one physical unit; entities can be distributed, replicated etc. However, all implementations are based on the same logical reference model of the system architecture as shown in Figure 4.18. A global network connects the local communication structure to the outside world and offers its services via the interface D1. Global networks could be integrated services digital networks (ISDN), public switched telephone networks (PSTN), public land mobile networks (PLMN), e.g., GSM, or packet switched public data network (PSPDN). The services offered by these networks include transportation of data and the translation of addresses and routing of data between the local networks. 

Local networks in the DECT context offer local telecommunication services that can include everything from simple switching to intelligent call forwarding, address translation etc. Examples for such networks are analog or digital private branch exchanges (PBXs) or LANs, e.g., those following the IEEE 802.x family of LANs. As the core of the DECT system itself is quite simple, all typical network functions have to be integrated in the local or global network, where the databases home data base (HDB) and visitor data base (VDB) are also located. Both databases support mobility with functions that are similar to those in the HLR and VLR in GSM systems. Incoming calls are automatically forwarded to the current subsystem responsible for the DECT user, and the current VDB informs the HDB about changes in location

**Protocol Architecture**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UO0cjFy.png)

The DECT protocol reference architecture follows the OSI reference model. Figure 4.19 shows the layers covered by the standard: the physical layer, medium access control, and data link control8 for both the control plane (C-Plane) and the user plane (U-Plane). An additional network layer has been specified for the C-Plane, so that user data from layer two is directly forwarded to the U-Plane.A management plane vertically covers all lower layers of a DECT system.

**Physical layer**
As in all wireless networks, the physical layer comprises all functions for modulation/
demodulation, incoming signal detection, sender/receiver synchronization,
and collection of status information for the management plane. This layer generates
the physical channel structure with a certain, guaranteed throughput. On request
from the MAC layer, the physical layer assigns a channel for data transmission.

**Medium access control layer**
The medium access control (MAC) layer establishes, maintains, and releases
channels for higher layers by activating and deactivating physical channels. MAC
multiplexes several logical channels onto physical channels. Logical channels
exist for signaling network control, user data transmission, paging, or sending
broadcast messages. Additional services offered include segmentation/reassembly
of packets and error control/error correction.

**Data link control layer**
The data link control (DLC) layer creates and maintains reliable connections
between the mobile terminal and the base station. Two services have been
defined for the C-Plane: a connectionless broadcast service for paging (called
Lb) and a point-to-point protocol similar to LAPD in ISDN, but adapted to the
underlying MAC (called LAPC+Lc).

**Network layer**
The network layer of DECT is similar to those in ISDN and GSM and only exists
for the C-Plane. This layer provides services to request, check, reserve, control,
and release resources at the fixed station (connection to the fixed network, wireless
connection) and the mobile terminal (wireless connection). The mobility
management (MM) within the network layer is responsible for identity management,
authentication, and the management of the location data bases. Call
control (CC) handles connection setup, release, and negotiation. Two message
services, the connection oriented message service (COMS) and the connectionless
message service (CLMS) transfer data to and from the interworking
unit that connects the DECT system with the outside world.

**TETRA**

Trunked radio systems constitute another method of wireless data transmission. These systems use many different radio carriers but only assign a specific carrier to a certain user for a short period of time according to demand. While, for example, taxi services, transport companies with fleet management systems and rescue teams all have their own unique carrier frequency in traditional systems, they can share a whole group of frequencies in trunked radio systems for better frequency reuse via FDM and TDM techniques. These types of radio systems typically offer interfaces to the fixed telephone network, i.e., voice and data services, but are not publicly accessible. These systems are not only simpler than most other networks, they are also reliable and relatively cheap to set up and operate, as they only have to cover the region where the local users operate, e.g., a city taxi service.

# UMTS - Third Generation Telecommunications System 

  

*The Third Generation Mobile System is the future mobile communication technology that carries existing and future services on a unified platform. The platform is designed in a way that technology changes and evolvements can be adapted to the network without causing any harm to the existing services using the existing network structure. The International Telecommunication Unit refers to Third Generation Mobile System as IMT-2000 which refers not only to be approximate year when it was expected to be launched but also the operating frequency band of around 2000 Mega Hertz.*



UMTS employs WCDMA at the air interface which provides access rates as indicated below.

Satellite communication introduces another system supporting mobile communications. Satellites offer global coverage without wiring costs for base stations and are almost independent of varying population densities.  After a short history of satellite development and presentation of different areas of application, this chapter introduces the basics of satellite systems. Orbit, visibility, transmission quality, and other system characteristics are all closely linked. Several restrictions and application requirements result in three major classes of satellites, GEO, MEO, and LEO.

Satellite communication began after the Second World War. Scientists knew that it was possible to build rockets that would carry radio transmitters into space. In 1945, Arthur C. Clarke published his essay on ‘Extra Terrestrial Relays’. But it was not until 1957, in the middle of the cold war, that the sudden launching of the first satellite SPUTNIK by the Soviet Union shocked the Western world. SPUTNIK is not at all comparable to a satellite today, it was basically a small sender transmitting a periodic ‘beep’. But this was enough for the US to put all its effort into developing its first satellite. Only three years later, in 1960, the first reflecting communication satellite ECHO was in space. ECHO was basically a mirror in the sky enabling communication by reflecting signals. Three years further on, the first geostationary (or geosynchronous) satellite SYNCOM followed. Even today, geostationary satellites are the backbone of news Satellite systems broadcasting in the sky. Their great advantage, is their fixed position in the sky (see section 5.3.1). Their rotation is synchronous to the rotation of the earth, so they appear to be pinned to a certain location. The first commercial geostationary communication satellite INTELSAT 1 (also known as ‘Early Bird’) went into operation in 1965. It was in service for one-and-a-half years, weighed 68 kg and offered 240 duplex telephone channels or, alternatively, a single TV channel. INTELSAT 2 followed in 1967, INTELSAT 3 in 1969 already offered 1,200 telephone channels. While communication on land always provides the alternative of using wires, this is not the case for ships at sea. Three MARISAT satellites went into operation in 1976 which offered worldwide maritime communication. However, Sender and receiver still had tobe installed on the ships with large antennas (1.2 m antenna, 40 W transmit power). The first mobile satellite telephone system, INMARSAT-A, was introduced in 1982. Six years later, INMARSAT-C became the first satellite system to offer mobile phone and data services. (Data rates of about 600 bit/s, interfaces to the X.25 packet data network exist.) In 1993, satellite telephone systems finally became fully digital with INMARSAT-M. The actual mobility, however, was relative from a user’s point of view, as the devices needed for communication via geostationary satellites were heavy (several kilograms) and needed a lot of transmit power to achieve decent data rates. Nineteen ninety-eight marked the beginning of a new age of satellite data communication with the introduction of global satellite systems for small mobile phones, such as, e.g., Iridium and Globalstar (see section 5.7). There are currently almost 200 geostationary satellites in commercial use which shows the impressive growth of satellite communication over the last 30 years (Miller, 1998), (Maral, 1998), (Pascall, 1997).However, satellite networks are currently facing heavy competition from terrestrial networks with nationwide coverage or at least enough coverage to support most applications and users.

Applications
Traditionally, satellites have been used in the following areas:

* Weather forecasting: Several satellites deliver pictures of the earth using, e.g., infra red or visible light. Without the help of satellites, the forecasting of hurricanes would be impossible.
* Radio and TV broadcast satellites: Hundreds of radio and TV programs are available via satellite. This technology competes with cable in many places, as it is cheaper to install and, in most cases, no extra fees have to be paid for this service. Today’s satellite dishes have diameters of 30–40 cm in central Europe, (the diameters in northern countries are slightly larger).
* Military satellites: One of the earliest applications of satellites was their use for carrying out espionage. Many communication links are managed via satellite because they are much safer from attack by enemies.
* Satellites for navigation: Even though it was only used for military purposes in the beginning, the global positioning system (GPS) is nowadays well-known and available for everyone.
* Global telephone backbones: One of the first applications of satellites for communication was the establishment of international telephone backbones. Instead of using cables it was sometimes faster to launch a new satellite (aka ‘big cable in the sky’)
* Connections for remote or developing areas: Due to their geographical location many places all over the world do not have direct wired connection to the telephone network or the internet (e.g., researchers on Antarctica) or because of the current state of the infrastructure of a country. Satellites now offer a simple and quick connection to global networks
* Global mobile communication: The latest trend for satellites is the support of global mobile data communication. Due to the high latency, geostationary satellites are not ideal for this task; therefore, satellites using lower orbits are needed

**GEO**
If a satellite should appear fixed in the sky, it requires a period of 24 hours. Using the equation for the distance between earth and satellite r = (g·R2/(2·π·f)2)1/3 and the period of 24 hours f = 1/24h, the resulting distance is 35,786 km. The orbit must have an inclination of 0 degrees.

* Advantages: Three GEO satellites are enough for a complete coverage of almost any spot on earth. Senders and receivers can use fixed antenna positions, no adjusting is needed. GEOs are ideal for TV and radio broadcasting. Lifetime expectations for GEOs are rather high, at about 15 years. GEOs typically do not need a handover due to the large footprint. GEOs do not exhibit any Doppler shift because the relative movement is zero. 

* Disadvantages: Northern or southern regions of the earth have more problems receiving these satellites due to the low elevation above a latitude of 60°, i.e., larger antennas are needed in this case. Shading of the signals in cities due to high buildings and the low elevation further away from the equator limit transmission quality. The transmit power needed is relatively high (some 10 W) which causes problems for battery powered devices. These satellites cannot be used for small mobile phones. The biggest problem for voice and also data communication is the high latency of over 0.25 s one-way – many retransmission schemes which are known from fixed networks fail. Due to the large footprint, either frequencies cannot be reused or the GEO satellite needs special antennas focusing on a smaller footprint. Transferring a GEO into orbit is very expensive.

**LEO** 

As LEOs circulate on a lower orbit, it is obvious that they exhibit a much shorter period (the typical duration of LEO periods are 95 to 120 minutes). Additionally, LEO systems try to ensure a high elevation for every spot on earth to provide a high quality communication link. Each LEO satellite will only be visible from the earth for around ten minutes. A further classification of LEOs into little LEOs with low bandwidth services (some 100 bit/s), big LEOs (some 1,000 bit/s) and broadband LEOs with plans reaching into the Mbit/s range can be found in Comparetto (1997).

* Advantages: Using advanced compression schemes, transmission rates of about 2,400 bit/s can be enough for voice communication. LEOs even provide this bandwidth for mobile terminals with omni-directional antennas using low transmit power in the range of 1W. The delay for packets delivered via a LEO is relatively low (approx 10 ms). The delay is comparable to long-distance wired connections (about 5–10 ms). Smaller footprints of LEOs allow for better frequency reuse, similar to the concepts used for cellular networks (Gavish, 1998). LEOs can provide a much higher elevation in polar regions and so better global coverage.

* Disadvantages: The biggest problem of the LEO concept is the need for many satellites if global coverage is to be reached. Several concepts involve 50–200 or even more satellites in orbit. The short time of visibility with a high elevation requires additional mechanisms for connection handover between different satellites. (Different cases for handover are explained in section 5.4.) The high number of satellites combined with the fast movements results in a high complexity of the whole satellite system. One general problem of LEOs is the short lifetime of about five to eight years due to atmospheric drag and radiation from the inner Van Allen belt1. Assuming 48 satellites and a lifetime of eight years (as expected for the system Globalstar), a new satellite would be needed every two months. The low latency via a single LEO is only half of the story. Other factors are the need for routing of data packets from satellite to satellite (or several times from base stations to satellites and back) if a user wants to communicate around the world. Due to the large footprint, a GEO typically does not need this type of routing, as senders and receivers are most likely in the same footprint.

**MEO**
MEOs can be positioned somewhere between LEOs and GEOs, both in terms of
their orbit and due to their advantages and disadvantages.

* Advantages: Using orbits around 10,000 km, the system only requires a dozen satellites which is more than a GEO system, but much less than a LEO system. These satellites move more slowly relative to the earth’s rotation allowing a simpler system design (satellite periods are about six hours). Depending on the inclination, a MEO can cover larger populations, so requiring fewer handovers. 

* Disadvantages: Again, due to the larger distance to the earth, delay increases to about 70–80 ms. The satellites need higher transmit power and special antennas for smaller footprints.

**Routing**

A satellite system together with gateways and fixed terrestrial networks as shown in Figure 5.1 has to route data transmissions from one user to another as any other network does. Routing in the fixed segment (on earth) is achieved as usual, while two different solutions exist for the satellite network in space. If satellites offer ISLs, traffic can be routed between the satellites. If not, all traffic is relayed to earth, routed there, and relayed back to a satellite. Assume two users of a satellite network exchange data. If the satellite system supports ISLs, one user sends data up to a satellite and the satellite forwards it to the one responsible for the receiver via other satellites. This last satellite now sends the data down to the earth. This means that only one uplink and one downlink per direction is needed. The ability of routing within the satellite network reduces the number of gateways needed on earth. If a satellite system does not offer ISLs, the user also sends data up to a satellite, but now this satellite forwards the data to a gateway on earth. Routing takes place in fixed networks as usual until another gateway is reached which is responsible for the satellite above the receiver. Again data is sent up to the satellite which forwards it down to the receiver. This solution requires two uplinks and two downlinks. Depending on the orbit and the speed of routing in the satellite network compared to the terrestrial network, the solution with ISLs might offer lower latency. The drawbacks of ISLs are higher system complexity due to additional antennas and routing hard- and software for the satellites.



**Localization**
Localization of users in satellite networks is similar to that of terrestrial cellular networks. One additional problem arises from the fact that now the ‘base stations’, i.e., the satellites, move as well. The gateways of a satellite network maintain several registers. A home location register (HLR) stores all static information about a user as well as his or her current location. The last known location of a mobile user is stored in the visitor location register (VLR). Functions of the VLR and HLR are similar to those of the registers in, e.g., GSM (see chapter 4). A particularly important register in satellite networks is the satellite user mapping register (SUMR). This stores the current position of satellites and a mapping of each user to the current satellite through which communication with a user is possible. 

Registration of a mobile station is achieved as follows. The mobile station initially sends a signal which one or several satellites can receive. Satellites receiving such a signal report this event to a gateway. The gateway can now determine the location of the user via the location of the satellites. User data is requested from the user’s HLR, VLR and SUMR are updated. Calling a mobile station is again similar to GSM. The call is forwarded to a gateway which localizes the mobile station using HLR and VLR. With the help of the SUMR, the appropriate satellite for communication can be found and the connection can be set up.



**Handover**
An important topic in satellite systems using MEOs and in particular LEOs is handover. Imagine a cellular mobile phone network with fast moving base stations. This is exactly what such satellite systems are – each satellite represents a base station for a mobile phone. Compared to terrestrial mobile phone networks, additional instances of handover can be necessary due to the movement of the satellites.

* Intra-satellite handover: A user might move from one spot beam of a satellite to another spot beam of the same satellite. Using special antennas, a satellite can create several spot beams within its footprint. The same effect might be caused by the movement of the satellite.

* Inter-satellite handover: If a user leaves the footprint of a satellite or if the satellite moves away, a handover to the next satellite takes place. This might be a hard handover switching at one moment or a soft handover using both satellites (or even more) at the same time (as this is possible with CDMA systems). Inter-satellite handover can also take place between satellites if they support ISLs. The satellite system can trade high transmission quality for handover frequency. The higher the transmission quality should be, the higher the elevation angles that are needed. High elevation angles imply frequent handovers which in turn, make the system more complex. 

* Gateway handover: While the mobile user and satellite might still have good contact, the satellite might move away from the current gateway. The satellite has to connect to another gateway.

* Inter-system handover: While the three types of handover mentioned above take place within the satellite-based communication system, this type of handover concerns different systems. Typically, satellite systems are used in remote areas if no other network is available. As soon as traditional cellular networks are available, users might switch to this type usually because it is cheaper and offers lower latency. Current systems allow for the use of dual-mode (or even more) mobile phones but unfortunately, seamless handover between satellite systems and terrestrial systems or vice versa has not been possible up to now.
